# semantic-markup

## Description

The objective of this project was to practice refactoring a web application, without altering its appearance or functionality. Key changes to the web application as part of the refactoring process included using semantic HTML tags and alt attributes in order to improve the accessability of the web application.

Throughout the refactoring process, as tags such as div were updated to more semantic tags, the CSS stylesheet needed to be updated to reflect those changes. As part of this process, the CSS selectors and properties were also consolidated to be more efficient and then reordered to follow the order of the elements and classes as they appear in the HTML file.

The title element was also updated to include the name of the company.
